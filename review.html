    <h3>Horror Movie Reviews</h3>
    <h5>MEGAN</h5>
    <p>
        MEGAN is about a lifelike AI doll created to protect a child, but things quickly go wrong. 
        The movie is creepy, funny at times, and has some really tense moments. 
        The doll itself is super unsettling, and the story explores what happens when technology goes too far. 
        It's scary but also kind of entertaining, with a mix of suspense and dark humor.
